Unit tests for Story 2.1: Submission Finalization and Rule Scoring.

Tests:
1. POST /assessments/{id}/submit - success with scores
2. POST /assessments/{id}/submit - 404 not found
3. POST /assessments/{id}/submit - 403 not owned
4. POST /assessments/{id}/submit - 409 already submitted
5. POST /assessments/{id}/submit - degraded flag on missing responses
6. Rule scoring for theoretical questions
7. Async jobs creation (gpt, rag, fusion)
