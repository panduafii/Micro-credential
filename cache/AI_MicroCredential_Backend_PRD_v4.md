# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
## AI-Powered Micro-Credential Assessment Backend — BMAD PRD v4

---

### **Section 1 — Project Overview**
**1.1 Purpose**
The purpose of this project is to build an AI-powered Micro-Credential Assessment Backend that objectively measures students’ theoretical and applied skills while producing personalized micro-credential recommendations.

The system utilizes an asynchronous FastAPI architecture, hybrid scoring (rule-based + GPT), and a RAG-powered retrieval engine to deliver scalable, trustworthy, and contextually relevant results. This backend forms the intelligent core of a broader ecosystem — dashboards, advisor tools, and learning pathway apps — providing actionable guidance grounded in data and AI-verified context.

**Rationale:**
- Hybrid GPT + RAG evaluation ensures balanced credibility and explainability.
- Async infrastructure supports high concurrency within budget constraints.
- Modular design simplifies future integration with analytic and adaptive learning features.

**1.2 Background Context**
Traditional academic tools rely on static testing and generic course recommendations. This project addresses that limitation through a backend capable of interpreting students’ answers and linking them to relevant micro-credentials via a RAG pipeline and GPT-based summarization.
