# Next Steps

## UX Expert Prompt
"You are the UX Expert focused on translating this PRD into interface concepts. Using the role-gated assessment flow, async status visibility, and RAG transparency requirements described here, outline the key user journeys and propose wireframe-level layouts for the student dashboard, advisor console, and admin operations screen. Prioritize clarity around role selection, progress tracking, and recommendation explainability."

## Architect Prompt
"You are the Software Architect responsible for implementing the AI-powered Micro-Credential Assessment Backend MVP defined in this PRD. Design a detailed architecture plan covering FastAPI modular monolith structure, Redis queue configuration, GPT/RAG integration patterns, database schema/migrations, deployment topology (local Docker → ECS Fargate), and observability setup. Explicitly address role-based question selection, degraded-mode fallbacks, latency/cost targets, and scaling to ≥100 concurrent assessments."
