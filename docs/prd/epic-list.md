# Epic List
- Epic 1 – Role-Gated Assessment Foundation: Stand up the FastAPI monorepo, JWT auth, role/track catalog, question bank CRUD, and `/assessments/start` flow so students pick a role and receive the 10-question bundle.
- Epic 2 – Async Scoring and Persistence Backbone: Deliver rule-based scoring inline, Redis queue plus worker for GPT essays, Postgres persistence, status polling/webhooks, and degraded-mode handling.
- Epic 3 – Recommendations, Transparency, and Feedback Loop: Implement RAG retrieval tuned by role context, fusion summary with traceable sources, advisor/student feedback capture, and dashboards to surface results and observability insights.
