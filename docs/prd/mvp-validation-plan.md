# MVP Validation Plan
- **Pilot Cohort:** Run the MVP with at least 30 students and 5 advisors across two academic programs during Week 4, capturing quantitative metrics (latency, recommendation acceptance) and qualitative feedback.
- **Success Criteria:** Achieve ≥70% student satisfaction, ≥80% advisor trust rating, and ≤48-hour turnaround per assessment; degraded-mode incidents must remain <10% of total runs.
- **Feedback Loop:** Collect advisor/student feedback via in-product forms (FR10) and conduct follow-up interviews; feed insights into backlog grooming for post-MVP iterations.
- **Analytics & Instrumentation:** Instrument metrics dashboard to track queue depth and failure rates; review daily during pilot.
- **Go/No-Go Decision:** If success criteria met and no Sev-1 incidents outstanding, proceed to broader rollout planning; otherwise schedule remediation sprint focused on identified bottlenecks (GPT latency, RAG accuracy, or UX friction).
